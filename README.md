# Next Level Week 4 - RocketSeat

## This is my code for [https://nextlevelweek.com/](https://nextlevelweek.com/)

:construction: This project is under construction :construction:

<br>

In this edition, the NLW4 has three paths based on the following technologies: Node, Elixir and React.

In the Elixir path, we will build a payment API.

In the Node path, we will build a Net Promoter Score - NPS.

In the React path, we will build a Pomodoro-like app.
