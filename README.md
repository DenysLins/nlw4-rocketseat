# [Next Level Week 4 - RocketSeat](https://nextlevelweek.com/)

Next Level Week is an online event promoted by Rocketseat, where, during a week, we can build an app. The fourth edition occurred between 02/22/2021 and 02/26/2021.

In the fourth edition, the NLW#4 had three paths based on the following technologies: Elixir, Node and React.

In the Elixir path, we developed a payment API.

In the Node path, built a Net Promoter Score - NPS API.

And in the React path, we made a Pomodoro-like app.
