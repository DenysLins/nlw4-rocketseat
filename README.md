# [Next Level Week 4 - RocketSeat](https://nextlevelweek.com/)

_Next Level Week_ is an online event promoted by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), where, during an entire week, you will build a complete application. The fourth edition occurred between the days 22 and 26 of February 2021.

In the fourth edition, the NLW#4 had three paths based on the following technologies: Elixir, Node and React.

In the Elixir path, we developed a payment API. The code of this API can be found in the folder rocketpay.

In the Node path, built a Net Promoter Score - NPS API. The code can be found in the nps folder.

And in the React path, we made a Pomodoro-like app. The code is in the moveit folder.
